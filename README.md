Software engineer & recovering mathematician. I work at SoundCloud, predominantly on the iOS application.

I like category theory, programming languages & types. I'm currently working through [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/), [but in Rust rather than Java](https://github.com/matthew-healy/crafting-interpreters-rust).

My pronouns are he or they. You choose. 💁‍♀️
