Software engineer, amateur comedian & recovering mathematician. I currently work in the authentication domain at SoundCloud.

I like programming languages, category theory & types. I'm interested in issues surrounding the ergonomics of complex type systems, and I'm currently trying to teach myself enough programming langauge theory to contribute work in that area.

My pronouns are they/them.
