Software engineer, amateur comedian & recovering mathematician. I work at SoundCloud.

I like programming languages, category theory & types. I'm currently working through Benjamin Pierce's Types & Programming Languages and re-reading Tom Leinster's Basic Category Theory, as well as trying to deepen my Haskell knowledge. That said, I get distracted easily by shiny things (ooh, Lean looks cool), so who knows how long this will be valid for.

My pronouns are they or he. You choose. 💁‍♀️
