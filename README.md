Software engineer, amateur comedian & recovering mathematician. I work at SoundCloud.

I like category theory, programming languages & types. I'm currently working through the second half of [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/), having completed the first half [in Rust rather than Java](https://github.com/matthew-healy/crafting-interpreters-rust).

I'm also attempting to write a small programming language which allows users to add their own compiler checks through a limited form of dependent typing. Who knows how that'll turn out.

My pronouns are they or he. You choose. 💁‍♀️
