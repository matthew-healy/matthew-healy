Software engineer, amateur comedian & recovering mathematician. I work at SoundCloud.

I like programming languages, category theory & types. I'm currently working through Types & Programming Languages and trying to deepen my Haskell knowledge, but I get distracted easily by shiny things, so who knows how long this will be valid for.

My pronouns are they or he. You choose. 💁‍♀️
